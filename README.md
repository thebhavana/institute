_**Agile Principles**_

* Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuos delivery of valuable software.
*  Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness changes for the customer's competitive advantage.
* Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with preference to the shorter timescale.
* Business people and developers must work daily throughout the project.
* Build project around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
* The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
* Working software is the primary measure of progress.
* Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
* Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
* Simplicity-the art of maximizing the amount of work not done-is essential.
* The best architecture, requirements, and design emerges from self-organising teams.
* At regular intervals the team reflects on how to become more effective, the tunes and adjusts its behaviour accordingly.
